This document outlines all existing problems found in the SplitSmart AI application, prioritized by severity and impact.

---

## ✅ **RESOLVED CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES**

### **1. API Key Exposure in Client Bundle** 🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW**

**Files:** `vite.config.ts`, `services/geminiService.ts`  
**Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Security vulnerability  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Migrated to secure serverless proxy

#### The Problem:

The previous configuration embedded the `GEMINI_API_KEY` directly into the client-side JavaScript bundle, making it publicly accessible to anyone inspecting the application's source code.

#### The Secure Solution:

A serverless function (`/functions/api/parse-expense.ts`) has been implemented to act as a secure backend proxy.

- **Frontend (`services/geminiService.ts`):** Now sends a request to the internal `/api/parse-expense` endpoint _without_ the API key.
- **Backend (`functions/api/parse-expense.ts`):** This server-side function receives the request, securely accesses the `GEMINI_API_KEY` from its environment variables, makes the call to the Google Gemini API, and returns the result to the frontend.

**The API key never leaves the secure server environment.**

#### Security Impact of Fix:

- ✅ **API Key Theft Prevented**: The key is no longer in the client bundle.
- ✅ **Unauthorized Usage Blocked**: Only our backend can use the key.
- ✅ **Rate Limit & Cost Protection**: Malicious users cannot abuse the API.

---

## ✅ **OTHER RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **1. TypeScript Compilation Errors** _(FIXED)_

**File:** `screens/AddExpenseScreen.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Fixed:** All 14 TypeScript errors resolved

#### What Was Fixed:

- Added proper type casting for `Object.entries(participantSplits)` operations
- Fixed `Object.values(participantSplits)` type assertions
- Resolved `participantSplits[userId]` type issues with explicit casting
- All participant split calculations now compile correctly

---

### **2. Poor User Experience with Alert Dialogs** _(FIXED)_

**Files:** Multiple screens throughout the app  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Fixed:** Implemented professional toast notification system

#### What Was Fixed:

- Created `Toast.tsx` component with animations and proper styling
- Added `ToastContext.tsx` for app-wide notification management
- Created `useToast.ts` hook for easy access to notifications
- Replaced all 8+ `alert()` calls with contextual toast messages
- Added proper dark mode support and improved visibility (80% opacity)

---

## 🟠 **HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **1. Memory Leaks - Missing useEffect Cleanup**

**Files:** `screens/AddExpenseScreen.tsx`, `components/common/Toast.tsx`  
**Severity:** HIGH - Memory leaks potential

#### Current Issues:

```typescript
// ISSUE 1: Potential cleanup issues in Toast.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setIsVisible(false);
    setTimeout(() => onRemove(toast.id), 300); // ⚠️ Nested timeout not cleaned up
  }, toast.duration || 5000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer); // ✅ Outer timer cleaned up, but not inner
}, [toast.id, toast.duration, onRemove]);

// ISSUE 2: Currency conversion effects may need cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const fetchRate = async () => {
    // ... async logic
    if (!controller.signal.aborted) {
      // update state
    }
  };
  fetchRate();
  return () => controller.abort(); // Needs AbortController for cleanup
}, [originalAmount, originalCurrency, selectedGroup]);
```

**Impact:**

- Potential memory leaks if components unmount before timeouts complete
- Could cause performance degradation over time
- Async operations may continue after component unmount

## 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **2. Accessibility Issues**

**Files:** Multiple components throughout the app  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Accessibility compliance

#### Missing Features:

- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Focus management in modals
- High contrast mode support

**Examples of Issues:**

```typescript
// ISSUE 1: Missing ARIA labels
<button onClick={() => setIsAiAssistantOpen(prev => !prev)}>
  {/* Missing aria-expanded, aria-controls, etc. */}
  <ICONS.CHEVRON_DOWN className="..." />
</button>

// ISSUE 2: No keyboard navigation
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-3">
  {selectedGroup.members.map(member => (
    <button onClick={() => handleParticipantToggle(member.id)}>
      {/* No keyboard focus indicators or navigation */}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>

// ISSUE 3: Color-only information
<span className={amount >= 0 ? 'text-green-500' : 'text-red-500'}>
  {/* Information conveyed only through color */}
</span>
```

#### Recommendations:

- Add proper ARIA labels and roles
- Implement keyboard navigation with Tab/Enter/Space
- Add screen reader text for visual-only information
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios

---

### **3. Debug Code in Production**

**Files:** Multiple files  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Code cleanliness

#### Issues Found:

- The app uses `console.warn`, `console.error`, etc. A dedicated, environment-aware logger (`loggerService.ts`) has been added but is not yet fully integrated everywhere.

**Problems:**

- Console statements visible in production
- Potential information leakage
- Unprofessional appearance in browser dev tools

#### Recommendations:

- Fully replace all `console.*` calls with the new `logger` service.
- Ensure logger level is set to `ERROR` in production builds.

---

### **4. Performance Issues**

**Files:** Large components and unoptimized renders  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Performance impact

#### **4.1 Large Component Files**

| File                    | Lines | Issue                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `AddExpenseScreen.tsx`  | 600+  | Extremely large, multiple responsibilities |
| `GroupDetailScreen.tsx` | 400+  | Complex state management                   |

#### **4.2 Missing Performance Optimizations**

```typescript
// ISSUE: No memoization for expensive calculations
const { totalAllocated, remaining } = React.useMemo(() => {
  // This calculation runs on every render
}, [participantSplits, amount, splitType]);

// ISSUE: Event handlers recreated on every render
const handleParticipantToggle = (userId: string) => {
  // Should use useCallback
};
```

#### Recommendations:

- Split large components into smaller, focused components
- Add `useCallback` for event handlers
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Implement proper React key props for lists

---

### **5. Data Validation Issues**

**Files:** Form inputs throughout the app  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Data integrity

#### Current State:

- A comprehensive `validationService.ts` using Zod has been created.
- However, it is not yet fully integrated into all forms. The `AddExpenseScreen` still uses manual, less robust validation.

#### Missing Integrations:

- `AddExpenseScreen` should be refactored to use `ValidatedForm` and `expenseFormSchema`.
- `GroupsScreen` group creation modal should use `ValidatedForm` and `groupCreationSchema`.
- File uploads in `AttachmentManager` and `AIAssistant` use the validation service, which is good.

---

## 🔵 **LOW PRIORITY ISSUES**

### **6. Code Quality & Architecture**

#### **6.1 Mixed Concerns**

**Severity:** LOW - Maintainability

- Business logic is sometimes mixed with UI components.
- There is now a good separation of concerns for API calls, validation, and state management, but components could be broken down further.

#### **6.2 Technical Debt**

```typescript
// ISSUE: Hardcoded values
const CURRENCIES = [
  /* hardcoded list */
];

// ISSUE: Mock data mixed with real logic
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); // Artificial delay

// ISSUE: No proper constants management
className = 'w-6 h-6 text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400'; // Repeated styles
```

---

## 🎯 **Current Status & Next Steps**

The application has undergone significant improvements and is now in a much more stable and professional state.

### **✅ Major Accomplishments:**

- ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW RESOLVED**: API key is now secure.
- ✅ All critical compilation errors resolved.
- ✅ Professional user experience with toast notifications.

### **📊 Overall Progress:**

**Before:** 🔴 Critical security flaw, blocking errors.
**Now:** 🟢 Stable, functional, and secure application.
**Goal:** 🌟 Production-ready app with excellent UX and accessibility.
